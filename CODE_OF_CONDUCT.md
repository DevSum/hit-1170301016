# Code of Conduct

Every building of a thousand floors begins with a single brick.

I start this project with a single hello world, and everyone can add features whatever they want.

We need imagination.

## Our Standards

As said above, any idea is welcomed. There are only several limits you need to obey:

- Being kind to others
- No personal attack
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- No illegal things

## Contact Information

If you believe that someone disobey our standard, or have any other concerns, please contact us immediately.
